🌏 Multilingual Live eBook Brain Chatbot

A Python-based AI assistant for querying eBooks in multiple languages.
Supports PDF, EPUB, and TXT files with LoRA-based incremental fine-tuning, summarization, and semantic search using FAISS embeddings.

✨ Features

🌐 Multilingual Support: Hindi, English, and more via facebook/mbart-large-50

📄 File Formats Supported: .pdf, .epub, .txt

⚡ Incremental Training with LoRA: Efficient fine-tuning of large language models with minimal GPU memory

🔍 Semantic Search: Uses SentenceTransformers + FAISS for relevant chunk retrieval

📝 Summarization: Summarizes content chunks before indexing for better answers

💬 Live Q&A: Ask questions in the same language as the content; model responds contextually

🖥️ Responsive GUI: Built with Gradio, supports drag & drop of eBooks

🧵 Threaded Updates: Adds new books and updates embeddings/models in the background

🔧 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multilingual-ebook-brain.git

⚙️ Usage
Launch GUI
python your_script_name.py

How to Use

Drag & drop eBooks (.pdf, .epub, .txt) into the interface

Let the system summarize and embed the content

Ask questions in the same language as the book

Answers are generated by the fine-tuned model in real-time

🧠 Technical Details

Model: facebook/mbart-large-50

Fine-tuning: LoRA incremental updates for low-memory training

Embeddings & Search: FAISS vector database for semantic search

Chunking & Summarization: Breaks text into chunks, summarizes, and indexes

GUI: Gradio interface for interactive queries

Threading: Background updates for adding new books and refreshing embeddings
